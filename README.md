### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having worked in bioinformatics in a cancer institute for the past four years, my strengths lie in analyzing various types of next-generation sequencing data in the context of both translating results to the clinic and contributing to research. 

I currently work on creating/maintaining easy-to-run, reproducible and robust data analysis pipelines to process sequencing data and create reports to support molecular tumor boards. I can effectively communicate results to oncologists, pharmacists, nurses and other clinical providers. 

I am interested in using bioinformatics to inform decisions made in the clinic about therapy and prognosis, especially as related to tumor heterogeneity, and combining DNA and RNA data.
