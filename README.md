### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having worked in bioinformatics in a cancer institute for the past five years, my strengths lie in analyzing various types of next-generation sequencing data in the context of translating results to the clinic and contributing to research. 

I currently work on creating/maintaining easy-to-run, reproducible and robust data analysis pipelines to process sequencing data and create reports to support molecular tumor boards in order to effectively communicate results to oncologists, pharmacists, nurses and other clinical providers. 

I am interested in using bioinformatics to inform decisions made in the clinic about therapy and prognosis, especially as related to tumor heterogeneity, and therapy resistance.
